# Fundamental of Information Retrieval NLP Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). The assignments cover various aspects of text processing, indexing, IR models, and model evaluation.

## Text Processing

In this section, we implement a comprehensive text processing pipeline using various libraries to process Persian text. The pipeline encompasses tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and other essential preprocessing steps. We aim to prepare the text data for further Information Retrieval tasks.

## Creating Posting List
This part of the repository focuses on the creation of a posting list structure from a collection of documents. We explore different techniques and strategies to efficiently construct posting lists. The implementations are tested on diverse datasets, including large corpora, to assess their performance on a substantial number of documents.

## IR Models

We delve into the world of Information Retrieval models, implementing and experimenting with various approaches, including:

- **Boolean Model**: A fundamental model that uses Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to retrieve relevant documents.

- **Jaccard Similarity Model**: Measuring document relevance based on Jaccard similarity between query terms and document terms.

- **Normalized Term Frequency Model**: Leveraging normalized term frequency to assess document relevance.

- **TF-IDF Model**: Implementing the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency model for improved document ranking.

## Evaluating IR and Ranking Models
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the implemented IR models using different evaluation metrics. We analyze the retrieval results to gain insights into the effectiveness of these models. The evaluation metrics may include `precision`, `recall`, `F1-score`, `DCG`, and more.
